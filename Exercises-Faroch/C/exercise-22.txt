Beskrivning
Make a program to read date time in the format of YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss from the input and validate it.
A leap year is exactly divisible by 4 except for century years (years ending with 00).
The century year is a leap year only if it is perfectly divisible by 400. 
If the year is a leap year, then February 29, is the leap day.
